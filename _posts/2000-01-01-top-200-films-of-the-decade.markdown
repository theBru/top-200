# Top 200 films of the decade, 2010 — 2019

{:#climax .film-name}
## *200.*{:.position} Climax

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Garpar Noé</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Garpar Noé</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">France, Belgium</span></p>

*A dance troupe organise a final party before their tour at the remote building where they've been rehearsing.*

It may be slightly more palatable for general consumption relative to his other films, but Gaspar Noé's latest experiment left me completely breathless by the end. The usual fluid camera and long, uncut scenes are still plenty, but how he paces this is truly astonishing. There is a 42-minute-uncut final scene (climax, if you will) which is as good as an example of nightmare on film I can think of. Unique in the truest sense.

{:#us .film-name}
## *199.*{:.position} US

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jordan Peele</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jordan Peele</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2019</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Us](/assets/img/us.jpg)

*A family run into their mute, murderous doppelgangers on a seaside trip.*

Jordan Peele's follow-up to the vastly successful (and vastly overrated) **Get out** is scarier than its predecessor and is not hampered by overt symbolism (though there is still a little bit of that here). It is a taut horror that delivers its scares in abundance and races to its finale in breakneck speed, with brilliant turns from Lupita Nyong'o and Shahadi Wright Joseph as the mother and daughter.

{:#the-house-that-jack-built .film-name}
## *198.*{:.position} The House That Jack Built

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Lars Von Trier</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Lars Von Trier</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, France, Sweden, Germany, Belgium</span></p>

![Still image from The House That Jack Built](/assets/img/the-house-that-jack-built.jpg)

*A failed architect recounts his violent murders to an angel.*

Don't call it a comeback, but Lars Von Trier needed something pretty special to make everyone forget about his bad joke from a few years ago. There are references to his previous work (some on-the-nose, some subtle), but if this is going to be his swansong as reported during its release, it is a fitting farewell from one of the best directors of our time — uncompromising, surprising, and still, sadly, uncomfortable in its treatment of women.

{:#booksmart .film-name}
## *197.*{:.position} Booksmart

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Olivia Wilde</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel, Katie Silberman</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2019</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Booksmart](/assets/img/booksmart.jpg)

*Two high school best friends attempt to cram all the partying they missed out on the eve of their graduation.* 

Taking its cue from the best of high school comedies of yore, this is a smart, honest, and consistently laugh-out-loud funny. There is not a moment wasted as their world is superbly realised — an amazing feat by a first-time director. A film like this will rise or fall on its actors pulling off the best-friends chemistry and Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein deliver that in abundance.

{:#timbuktu .film-name}
## *196.*{:.position} Timbuktu

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Abderrahmane Sissako</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Abderrahmane Sissako, Kessen Tall</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Mauritania, France</span></p>

![Still image from Timbuktu](/assets/img/timbuktu.jpg)

*A herder and his family's life gets upended when Jihadists close in on their village.* 

Timbuktu, the land, conjures up conflicting images: it used to the land of unthinkable riches, it became an aspirational nirvana for the generation of '68, and now it's in the hands of a murderous cult. The film, which is one of the most stunningly beuatiful you will ever see, tries to maintain this balance, whilst showing all of these images are perhaps nothing but an outsider's perspective.

{:#starred-up .film-name}
## *195.*{:.position} Starred up

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">David Mackenzie</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jonathan Asser</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK</span></p>

![Still image from Starred up](/assets/img/starred-up.jpg)

*A young hardened convict is put in the same prison as his father.* 

Explosive from the start, this is a gritty prison drama that has more heart than it lets on. The performances are great throughout and without resorting to too many prison cliches, it manages to keep its modest premise alive all the way through. One of the shining lights of British cinema of this decade — sadly it wasn't a very popular one.

---

{:#julias-eyes .film-name}
## *194.*{:.position} Julia's Eyes

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Los ojos de Julia</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Guillem Morales</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Guillem Morales, Oriol Paulo</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Spain</span></p>

![Still image from Julia's Eyes](/assets/img/julias-eyes.jpg)

*A woman who is losing her sight is investigating her twin sister's death.* 

Carrying on from a rich surrealist cultural history, Spain have always produced top tier horror films and the decade started on a high with this creepy and disturbing film that bothers the ocula. Belén Rueda, who stars in another horror film higher up on this list, does a great job of balancing vulnerability and determination. Did I mention it was really scary?

{:#pina .film-name}
## *193.*{:.position} Pina

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Wim Wenders</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Wim Wenders</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Germany, France, UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Pina](/assets/img/pina.jpg)

*Pina Bausch's dancers perform some of her most famous pieces.* 

An ode to a woman who made poetic movement like no other, **Pina** is itself a celebration of moving pictures through another medium. If, at some point in the future, you end up catching this on a 3D showing on a big screen, make sure you don't miss. This is exactly the 3D technology was made for. Sit back, watch, and be in awe.

{:#ash-is-purest-white .film-name}
## *192.*{:.position} Ash Is Purest White

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Jiang hu er nü</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Zhangke Jia</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Zhangke Jia</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">China, France, Japan</span></p>

![Still image from Ash Is Purest White](/assets/img/ash-is-purest-white.jpg)

*A woman sacrifices her freedom for her mobster boyfriend only to be betrayed by him.* 

An allegory of the changing social and economic structures of China, Zhangke Jia's most recent film is a darkly funny and incredibly moving story of a woman who is trying to find som semblance of consistency in her life. It boasts a stunning performance by Tao Zhao, Zhangke Jia's wife.

---

{:#don-jon .film-name}
## *191.*{:.position} Don Jon

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Don Jon](/assets/img/don-jon.jpg)

*A porn addict tries to cure his addiction to be with the girl he is falling in love with.* 

Yet another debutant director who smashes it out of the park in a reversal of all romantic comedy cliches. It could have easily gone into the 'bro' zone, but Gordon-Levitt manages to steer the ship to calmer waters every time that opportunity rears its ugly head. It is funny, surprising affecting, and original.

{:#fruitvale-station .film-name}
## *190.*{:.position} Fruitvale Station

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Ryan Coogler</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Ryan Coogler</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Fruitvale Station](/assets/img/fruitvale-station.jpg)

*A day in the life of a young man who ends up being on the wrong train.* 

There is something very immediate about **Fruitvale Station** and it goes beyond the contemporary racio-political outlook. It posits its characters and its story with minimal embellishments and that makes the searing finale all the more disturbing. Fittingly enough, we are led on a trainwreck that feels can be prevented, but more often than not isn't.

---

{:#a-hijacking .film-name}
## *189.*{:.position} A Hijacking

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Kapringen</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tobias Lindholm</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tobias Lindholm</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark</span></p>

![Still image from A Hijacking](/assets/img/a-hijacking.jpg)

*A sailor on a cargo ship is taken hostage along with his crew by the pirates.* 

It is easy to forget that the Somali pirate crisis was a pretty big thing back in the day. Although we have a Tom- Hanks-starring (and pretty decent) **Captain Phillips**, it has nothing compared to the sheer terror and claustrophobic panic of this little-seen Danish film. 

---

{:#theeb .film-name}
## *188.*{:.position} Theeb

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Naji Abu Nowar</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Naji Abu Nowar, Bassel Ghandour</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UAE, Qatar, Jordan, UK</span></p>

![Still image from Theeb](/assets/img/theeb.jpg)

*A young boy acts as a guide to a British officer in Arabia during World War I.* 

A coming-of-age film with a setting not at all familiar to many people who have seen it, this is a beautiful slice of minimalist filmmaking. Visually and emotionally stunning, it is a film full of silences and echoes that say so much more than a memorable piece of dialogue. 

---

{:#mollys-game .film-name}
## *187.*{:.position} Molly's Game

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2017</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">China, Canada, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Molly's Game](/assets/img/mollys-game.jpg)

*A woman sets up an underground gambling club for the ultra rich.* 

As an Aaron Sorkin fanboy, the thought of him directing a film was giving me all the good vibes in all the right places. Whilst the result is not the life-changing event I was perhaps hoping for, it was still a feast for the ears. Not taking anything away from Jessica Chastain, though, as she gave it all to nd suceeded brilliantly in a role that may have otherwise been there merely to read out the script. 

---

{:#john-wick .film-name}
## *186.*{:.position} John Wick

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Chad Stahelski</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Derek Kolstad</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from John Wick](/assets/img/john-wick.jpg)

*A retired assassin hunts down the people who killed his dog.* 

Ignoring all of its meme-inducing cult status and the brilliantly choreographed fight sequences, the thing that makes **John Wick** stands head-and-shoulders above everything else of the same ilk is its world-building abilities. More so than anything else I can think of, it is effortless in its depiction of the idiosyncracies of its world. 

---

{:#stories-we-tell .film-name}
## *185.*{:.position} Stories We Tell

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sarah Polley</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sarah Polley, Michael Polley</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Canada</span></p>

![Still image from Stories We Tell](/assets/img/stories-we-tell.jpg)

*Director and actress Sarah Polley trawls through family videos to uncover stories from her family history.* 

An exercise in film-making to understand one's own existence is as old as cinema itself and while some examples excel (hello, Agnès Varda), most fail. Sarah Polley's own experiment is an eye-opening documentary that makes its very personal subjecty matter universally appealing and that's a rare talent to have.

{:#locke .film-name}
## *184.*{:.position} Locke

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Knight</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Knight</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Locke](/assets/img/locke.jpg)

*A construction sight foreman drives back to London overnight for a personal emergency on the eve of their grand opening.* 

If a film about a man driving at night and talking on the phone doesn't sound exciting or a suitable material for a thriller, then I've ogt some eye-opening news for you. Infinitely more exciting and nerve-racking than any city being annihilated by a super-hero, Tom Hardy gives a masterclass in minimalism in a film that is in itself a masterclass in minimalism.

{:#train-to-busan .film-name}
## *183.*{:.position} Train to Busan

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Busanhaeng</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sang-ho Yeon</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sang-ho Yeon, Joo-Suk Park</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2016</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">South Korea</span></p>

![Still image from Train to Busan](/assets/img/train-to-busan.jpg)

*A man and his daughter are stuck on a train when a zombie epidemic breaks out.* 

It could be reduced merely as a 'zombies on a train' film and it would actually be right. The contextual elements (couple going through divorce, overworked father and a strained parental relationship) are all moot points, thankfully. This is a balls-to-the-wall zombie epic that goes as fast as the bullet train we are stuck on for the most part.

{:#in-a-better-world .film-name}
## *182.*{:.position} In a Better World

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Hævnen</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Susanne Bier</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Anders Thomas Jensen</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, Sweden</span></p>

![Still image from In a Better World](/assets/img/in-a-better-world.jpg)

*Two young boys and their respective parents are struggling to cope with the issues at home.* 

What is striking about **In a Better World** is its juxtaposiion of a war zone that we see on television screens and the war zone that occurs just outside those screens. How these two seemingly differing worlds intertwine is what Susanne Bier's multi-award-winning film tries to show. There are no answers, but facts of life and people struggling to face those facts.

{:#the-body .film-name}
## *181.*{:.position} The Body

<p class="meta-tags"><em>El cuerpo</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Oriol Paulo</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Oriol Paulo, Lara Sendim</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Spain</span></p>

![Still image from The Body](/assets/img/the-body.jpg)

*A detective is investigating the murder and the missing body of a wealthy woman.* 

Fresh off **Julia's Eyes**, its writer Oriol Paulo brings back Belén Rueda for another chiller that he directs — this time of the pulpier variety. Although it may have benefited immensely from a mini-series treatment for its subject matter, it is a very well made old-school thriller with a bit of horror mixed in that will leave you guessing until the very end. Incredibly smart and surprising.

---

{:#upgrade .film-name}
## *180.*{:.position} Upgrade

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Leigh Whannell</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Leigh Whannell</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Australia</span></p>

![Still image from Upgrade](/assets/img/upgrade.jpg)

*A man volunteers for a computer implant after suffering a life-altering accident.* 

A low-budget sci-fi actioner, which tackles a contemporary subject in a way many films would have struggled to make any sense of — bionic human in an age of technophobia. But the premise supplants the plot perfectly and becomes a catalyst for some of the most ingenious action sequences since perhaps **The Matrix**. Between us, it is better than that film too. 

---

{:#lincoln .film-name}
## *179.*{:.position} Lincoln

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Spielberg</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tony Kushner</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA, India</span></p>

![Still image from Lincoln](/assets/img/lincoln.jpg)

*US President Abraham Lincoln tries to pass the emancipation legislation as the American Civil War is drawing to a close.* 

It's inevitably dominated by the greatest actor of his generation and without Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, this could have been a quality historical epic. It is an eerie performance of a man that none of us have seen in rea life, but I would guess nobody would question the authenticity of the performance. The rest of the film, of course, is also of the highest quality (this being a Spielberg film), but it indubitably belongs to Day-Lewis.

---

{:#moneyball .film-name}
## *178.*{:.position} Moneyball

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Bennett Miller</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from moneyball](/assets/img/moneyball.jpg)

*The general manager of the baseball team Oakland Athletics uses data analytics to create a championship winning team on a budget.* 

For sports-to-watch nerds like myself, the story of Billy Beane's use of analytics is a legendary tale and in the hands of Bennett Miller and co-screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (fanboy alert), it becomes a classy drama that not only manages to be compelling watch, but also an emotionally satisfying one. Especially if you tend to root for the underdog.

---

{:#only-god-forgives .film-name}
## *177.*{:.position} Only God Forgives

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Nicolas Winding Refn</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Niolas Winding Refn</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, France, USA, Sweden, Belgium</span></p>

![Still image from Only God Forgives](/assets/img/only-god-forgives.jpg)

*After his brother's death, a drug smuggler hunts down his killers as per his mother's insistence.* 

Released at the height of Ryan Gosling's meteoric rise to the hearts and minds of every film fan out there, **Only God Forgives** is a visually stunning film (albeit a little bit stunted on the pacing front) that refuses to hold back in its violence, both shown and obscured. It is a nightmarish film that slowly creeps under your skin and makes you forget how this all started by the time it ends.

---

{:#kick-ass .film-name}
## *176.*{:.position} Kick Ass

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Matthew Vaughn</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Kick Ass](/assets/img/kick-ass.jpg)

*A teenager decides to become a superhero despite having no discernible qualifications.* 

A giant fuck-you to any superhero story out there, there is something beautifully cathartic about Dave Lizewski succeeding in an industry that pretty much requires a tonne of money, smarts, or a radioactive bite or two. A punk anthem to your overblown pop rock anthems, if you like. A refreshing, funny-as-hell superhero film that probably will never be bettered.

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Taylor Sheridan</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Taylor Sheridan</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2017</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, Canada, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Wind River](/assets/img/wind-river.jpg)

*A hunter and an FBI agent track down the people who killed a young woman.* 

Shot in the harsh Wyoming winter, this is the story of a frozen limbo in which hope is as frozen and snowed under as the landscape that surrounds everybody. Although there is a slight undertone of white-man-saving-the-natives feeling there, it doesn't take anything away from the beautiful scenery and the sense of dreadful acceptance of the worst. There is a glimmer of hope in the end, but it's obvious that this is all a part of the cycle that will repeat itself.

{:#rebellion .film-name}
## *174.*{:.position} Rebellion

<p class="meta-tags"><em>L'ordre et la morale</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Mathieu Kassovitz</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Mathieu Kassovitz, Pierre Geller, Benoît Jaubert</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">France, New Caledonia</span></p>

![Still image from Rebellion](/assets/img/rebellion.jpg)

*After a police station in New Caledonia is overrun by rebels, France sends 300 soldiers to confront them.* 

Based on real events, what is striking about **Rebellion** is that it paints the political context behind the conflict better than most war films. Sure, there are impressive action sequences and compelling characters, but it's the bloodless conflict happening in the background (and thousands of miles away across two oceans) is the real driver behind all of the action on screen. And men and women are caught right in the middle of it.

![Still image from Moonlight](/assets/img/moonlight.jpg)

*An African-American man's struggle to come to terms with his identity and sexuality.* 

Without diminishing any of its qualities, **Moonlight** certainly benefitted the cultural zeitgeist when it was released. The fact that it took many this long to address the issue head-on is telling in itself, but even in isolation from its cultural context, Moonlight is a remarkable coming-of-age story with impeccable acting by a relatively unknown cast.

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Paddy Considine</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Paddy Considine</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK</span></p>

![Still image from Tyrannosaur](/assets/img/tyrannosaur.jpg)

*A rage-filled man finds redemption in the friendship of a Christian charity worker.* 

Peter Mullan, ever-present in many a British film as the tough guy, finds himself in the spotlight in Paddy Considine's feature directorial debut as the tough guy who softens up by an act of kindness he's been refused all his life. It is a difficult watch for many reasons, but the towering central performances by Mullan and the always brilliant Olivia Colman lift this up a level or ten. It is a mesmerising watch.

## *171.*{:.position} Mid90s

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jonah Hill</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jonah Hill</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Mid90s](/assets/img/mid90s.jpg)

*A lonely teenage boy joins a local skateboarding crew in mid 90s Los Angeles.* 

Jonah Hill's homage to the decade he grew up (the decade *I* grew up in also) is less a nostalgic yearning for a better time, but an unfiltered, but yet dreamlike, vision of what we get a glimpse of when watching music videos from that time. The naturalistic acting and filming lends an almost documentary-like feel and you would be hard-pressed to think otherwise. It is a delightful coming-of-age story -- and hopefully the first of many films to come from Hill behind the camera.

{:#the-place-beyond-the-pines .film-name}
## *170.*{:.position} The Place Beyond the Pines

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Derek Cianfrance</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Derek Cianfrance, Beb Coccio, Darius Mader</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from The Place Beyond the Pines](/assets/img/the-place-beyond-the-pines.jpg)

*A motorcycle stunt driver turns to robbing banks to provide for his family.* 

The second of Derek Cianfrance's 'failed marriage' films of the decade, **The Place Beyond the Pines** is perhaps the more audacious of the two (the other one appears higher on this list), but it is also the more flawed one. In fact, if there is one thing that would have carried this to a higher level would have been extending this to a mini-series. Regardless, it has a brilliant case throughout and will leave quite speechless by the end.

![Still image from Miss Violence](/assets/img/miss-violence.jpg)

*An eleventh-birthday party descends into chaos.* 

Much like the Romanian and Argentinean cinemas of the last decade, this decade's most interesting national cinema was Greek and **Miss Violence** is a brilliant example of it. A psychodrama the likes of which Yorgos Lanthimos has now exported to the English-language world, Alexandros Avranos's oddity pushes the boundaries even further. It is sick, funny, poignant, and endlessly watchable.

![Still image from Brawl in Cell Block 99](/assets/img/brawl-in-cell-block-99.jpg)

*A drug runner is tasked to murder an infamous prisoner to save his wife.* 

I don't particularly care for torture-porn, primarily because of it's usually irrelevant to the story, but used as a cheap plot device to carry home the idea of danger. Whilst **Brawl** doesn't quite match up in terms of the frequency, it is still a difficult watch in many a scene. Yet with an icy direction and a hypnotic pace (not forgetting Vince Vaughn's brilliant performance), it is a compelling film that manages to surprise despite its simplicity.

![Still image from The Fighter](/assets/img/the-fighter.jpg)

*An aspiring boxer tries to escape his troubled and more successful brother's shadow.* 

A very classic sports drama that dials up the cheese occasionally, but manages to stay grounded, much like its hero. There are some exceptional bits of acting from both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, but it's David O. Russell's understated direction that elevates this from a poor man's **Rocky**. It is effective, heartfelt, and genuinely exciting.

*A down-and-out father living in an ultra-orthodox Jewish community in New York is trying to win the custody of his son.* 

It brings the biggest of smiles to your face when you watch Menashe (played by the real-life stand-up comedian Menashe Lustig) manages to overcome each obstacle that comes his way. Trying to win over your son's custody is difficult enough, but managing the prejudices, traditions, and prohibitions of an ultra-orthodox Jewish community add even more on his plate. It's not all laughs though, you will shed tears too. All in all, this is pure cinema that takes you through all sorts of emotions. Simply beautiful.

What could have been easily a bro-move of a premise actually ended up being one of the gutsiest and most inventive romantic comedies of all time. It helps that the two stars are married in real life and that they are both fantastic in their respective roles. Zoe Kazan (the actress most featured in this list, interestingly) wrote a great script that is equal parts poignant and hilarious. And, yes, quite a bit creepy as well.

*A bouncer drives an African American musician in 1960s American South.* 

Did it deserve its critical panning upon its release? And more of it when it won the big prize? Definitely not. Whilst there is a valid argument whether its racial politics were a little too old-fashioned for our times, I don't think it was a biased decision. And you can also argue that it's just another version of **Driving Miss Daisy**, but without the cheese and with two stand-out performances. I enjoyed it — and that's OK.

*A quirky and affable mortician strikes up a friendship with an old welathy widow.* 

The forgotten Richard Linklater film of the decade, **Bernie** is an eerie tale of friendship and loyalty. Jack Black is absolutely spot-on as the titular mortician, who manages to stay just the right side of quirky without going overboard, while Shirley Temple is perfect as the miserly widow. The film manages to stray away from the creep zone it could have easily gone to. But thanks to an engaging script and Linklater's direction, it remains an endlessly watchable comedy.

*A young man moves in to the house of a family whose dead son he claims he was a friend of.* 

As predictable as rain in a music festival, **The Guest** doesn't try to be film of surprises and twists. It does exactly what it should and it does it really, really well — thrill. It's mindless entertainment, but in a tongue so firmly pressing the cheek it's piercing it. It's probably meant to be ironic, the whole early 90s TV thriller vibe, but it's so much more than that in many ways too.

It was never going to be as special as **Once**, which is (ahem) a once in a lifetime film. John Carney manages to capture some of that magic in his two leads (Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo) and although the story doesn't doesn't push any boundaries or lend itslef to any intense criticism, its warmth is undeniable. Carney genuinely loves music and how it brings people together in the most random ways imaginable.

*Five teenagers go to a remote cabin, where they unleash a number of evil spirits.* 

When the tongue is pressed so hardly against a cheek, there is usually a good chance of a breaking of that cheek. Drew Goddard's homage to every teens-in-the-woods film could have easily outwelcomed its presence within about 15 minutes — let's not forget, even the serious examples of this genre know its tropes can be ridiculous. But Goddard and co-writer Joss Whedon make sure that the ridiculous remain exactly that. And that the finale is overblown with no end in sight.

The true story this is based on is truly phenomenal. The film is also remarkable in how he sympathetically depicts its characters. Having said, all of that would have been irrelevant were it not for some amazing performances. Matthew McConaughey, in the height of his McConnaisance to become a top-tier actor, is brilliant as Ron Woodroof who sees a loophole and abuses it to great effect (and to great benefit to others). Jared Leto ain't so bad either.

That this is the highest entry for a Tarantino film in this list tells something about how much I've fallen out of favour of his style. But let's not digress and heap the praises that are due for this. Sufficiently quotable, interesting, with plenty of screen-chewing to go and a good dose of violent action, **Django Unchained** mauy in fact be quite underrated.

*Three environmental activists are planning to blow up a dam.* 

Coming in a handful of years prior to environmental activism to really take hold of mainstream consciousness (at least in the First World), I'd be curious to see how **Night Moves** would have been received were it released now. The film is synmpathetic to the cause, but it also doesn't shy away from the sheer destruction the act will cause. The three mains are also struggling with that, but they seem to offer no solution. Neither does the film. And that ambiguity is I think makes the whole thing that bit better.

*A married woman's lunchbox she prepared for her husband is accidentally gets delivered to a random office worker.* 

Leaving all traces of irony and cynicism at the door, this is nothing but a pure feelgood film. A love story that takes a few surprising turns, but Ritesh Batra never lets that distract you from all of the positive vibes happening on screen. The leads are given ample space to stretch themselves in roles that are sometimes nothing more than reading a note on a piece of paper, but the sumtuous cinematography makes sure that even those moments remain exciting.

*Exiled Czehoslovak soldiers plan to assassinate SS General Reinhard Heydrich.* 

You could argue that World War II films have saturated the war genre and that there isn't much new to tell. However, as with all wars, there is always a story to tell and **Antrhopoid** tells a very good one indeed. There is the inevitable comic-book villain Nazi officers and the usual War era scenery (music halls where Nazi officers mingle with local 'sell-outs', a young woman helping out the heroes etc), but everything is told very economically and with great detail as well.

*Estranged members of an Oklahoman family get together after a tragedy.* 

It may be a filmed stage play (it was based on one, anyway), but **August: Osage County** offers the viewers so much visual drama via its actors' faces. The dialogue, by Tracy Letts, is brilliant as expected and the turns from some of the cast are truly stunning. It's not the first dysfunctional family gathering that ends up in hugs (or doesn't, no spoilers), nor will it be the last one. But it may very well be one of the best ones.

I think my cheeks were hurting from all that smiling by the end of this. A wonderfully acted homage to friendship and summer, the film doesn't put a foot wrong in its entirety. Full of whimsical sequences, heartfelt encounters, and surprises galore. The only thing that I wish it did was to make its plot a little bit more heterogeneous. But that repetitivenes shouldn't bother anyone.

An old-school thriller, based on a novel by Jo Nesbo, **Headhunters** ticks all the right boxes for a Friday night viewing with pizza and a bunch of your mates. It starts off and continues at breakneck speed, but not without slowing down for some discernible human interaction . The ending does push the boundaries of logic slightly, but if you can overlook that, you will be immensely entertained.

*An identical planet to ours suddenly appear in the Solar System.* 

Astronomically nonsensical it might be, what really struck me about **Another Earth** is that it wasn't trying to counterbalance it with excess spirituality. Instead, it is nothing but a magical realist film of a depressed young woman trying to come to terms with a tragedy. In fact, the whole duplicate Earth thing becomes nothing more than a mere background to what she is going through in her head.

A coming-of-age story of an American teenager that is different from the others from its sheer audacity to be down to earth, rather than trying to be too showy, as these things tend to be. There is a genuine desperation in Hailee Steinfeld's performance as she tries to comes to terms with the new world order. It's also too funnt sometimes to watch it on a train with your headphones on as you might elicit a few turning heads and disapproving looks from your fellow passengers.

The age of the damn-dirty-ape is over and the second-time-revamped Apes universe came with a bang. Unlike its predecessors, it was realistic, tense, and realy scary for the first time This sequel works even better than its predecessor in making its apes evolve organically. Unlike their human counterparts, they have character arcs and are much more relatable. I think that's the mains success of the film.

Even though Woody Allen is a *persona non-grata* these days, I can't deny the brilliance of the man's filmmaking. And in **Blue Jasmine** he is at the hight og his powers. Yet, the film well and truly belongs to Cate Blanchett — a performance so perfect that it somewhat makes you think whether she is overdoing it. But no, even in scenes of apparent overacting, there is a sense of reality that seeps through well and clear. If for nothing else, watch it to watch her.

Not sure there has been this much fanfare for an arthouse film for a very long time and unfortunately the film just didn't live up to the expectations. Either way, we still got a brillint sci-fi that not only was cerebral, but also incredibly inventive in its premise. It's lacking a little plotwise, but that shouldn't take anything away from the incvredibly audacious premise (based on a comic book, no less).

*A deaf and mute writer is terrorised by a masked intruder in a secluded home.* 

An incredibly simple, yet effective film, **Hush** doesn't try to re-write the horror genre, but uses some of its best tropes to its advantage. When the breaking of the silence is the sign that danger is lurking around the corner, this is not the case here. For our protagonist, it's the same as long as the said danger is not within her eyesight. A clever premise that works really well.

If it were up to me Ricardo Darím should be in more films, but sadly it's not up to me. In **Carancho** he plays a noirish anti-hero who abuses his position to prey on innocent people when they are most vulnerable, but only Darín would be able to make this character palatable. It's not a one-man show, though. Martina Gusman's doctor brings in a measure of panache and control to the whole affair. A very well done noir thriller.

It is no surprise that Paul Thomas Anderson's film (and Thomas Pynchon's novel it is based on) is barely interested in the whys of the story. It's a film noir, which means the journey is more than half of the film. And the journey is full of wacky characters and unforgettable situations. As with the greatest of noir films, the plot drives the story, that very quickly goes out of hand into pretty awesome territories.

It's a proper feast for the eyes and the slighly pedestrian pace of the film helpls cement that. Whilst it may be short on elongated excitement (though, when it comes in bursts, it's awesome), it makes up for some of the most stunning scenery and mise-en-scene.

Colourful urban dramas with larger-than-life characters and encounters that have a life-changing impact on their lives is where he created some of the best films of this century.

There have been many adaptations of Leo Tolstoy's seminal novel, but none has really captured the carefree spirit of the original text. Keira Knightley is the perfect Anna — vulnerable, allluring, and yearning all at the same time. Period pieces feel especially aged these days, but **Anna Karenina** feels fresh and relevant in when viewing with today's cynicism. It is a beautiful film that is also one of the better adaptations of a classic in world literature.

*A poet is writing a poem that will get him in trouble in an obscenity trial.* 

I have a soft spot for Allen Ginsberg's *Howl* and any film that deals with it (in three different ways, no less) gets my vote. There are three narratives in the film: the events and the times that inspired Ginsberg to write the poem, the obscenity trial which put Ginsberg and the poem in public consciousness forever, and the animated version of the poem itself. Each part is individually captivating, but as a whole they work even better.

*Three police officers are involved in a cover-up and its investigation.* 

Now we're coming to the *really* good ones. **Felony** is a thriller that pits three amazing actors against each other in a cat-and-mouse show where the roles are reversed constantly. Whilst as the audience we knoe everything that is going on, how these characters will deal with each situation that's thrown at them is a joy to watch. A brilliant concept by Joel Edgerton, who wrote himself a great role.

*A hotelier in Alaska befriends the stranger that stays in one of his rooms.* 

I disliked Jon Bernthal immensely for his role in **The Walking Dead**, but since then he has been nothing short of brilliant. And he carries the former-rodeo-star-turned-wholesome-hotelier rather well. His moralising feels a natural act and the pent-up energy is waiting to burst out of him. That tension is incredibly powerful in scenes with Christopher Abbot's violent hotel guest. An economical and very effective thriller.

*British Army soldiers are surrounded in the city of Dunkirk iun Belgium and are waiting for evacuation.* 

If you approach this as a technical experiment in the art of narrative filmmaking and editing, then **Dunkirk** is up there with the greatest films ever made. What it sadly lacks in abundance is that for a story of such dramatric proportions, it is incredibly cold and distant from its subject. Hence, it averages out to here on this list.

*A civil servant's life turns upside down when his better-at-everything doppelgänger starts working in the same office as him.* 

Although based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, the film is more Kafka-esque than the Russian author's more internalised story. It is all about the absurdity of the situation and the pain that Simon (played wonderfully by Jesse Eisenberg) that go through becomes secondary ... until things get a really dark turn in the third act. It is an uneven film in many ways, but absolutely fascinating nonetheless.

*A couple's summer vacation is disrupted when the woman's ex pays them a visit with his new, much younger girlfriend.* 

An English-language remake of a European film on a favourites list?! Yes, that's really unlike me. Admittedley I haven't seen **La Piscine**, which this is based on, but if it's half as good as this, then I'm all in. This could have gone the route of sleaze pretty easily considering its premise, but it ends up being a tasteful and classy thriller that features one of the best pieces of acting on this list, from Ralph Fiennes — though his character may drive you mad at the same time.

*In a post-apocalyptic world, a journalist agrees to escort his boss's daughter through a quarantined zone in Central America.* 

What can you achieve (cinematically) with half a million dollars? In the case of former BBC special effects wiz, Gareth Edwards a kick-ass sci-fi that looks and feels every bit of a million-dollar franchise as any. Its aesthetics may seem mundane and routine these days, but that shouldn't take anything away from what Edwards achieved 10 years ago. Even if you didn't know the low budget, you would still be impressed to no end how accomplished this was/is.

*The year of a couple and their friends and family.* 

As mundane as the premise can be, it does make for quite a watch. When **Another Year** came out, I wrote (somewhere): "another year, another great Mike Leigh film". And it's exactly that, the quality you would expect from one of the best directors Britain have ever had (and there are plenty of great names out there). It is an eventless film about seemingly real people, with real issues played out in front of an unintrusive camera.

*An ageing playboy and socialite decides to tone down as he fears the end is near.* 

Paolo Sorrentino's ode to Fellini (and in particular to **8 1/2**) is sad, beautiful, and poignant. This may be secrilegous, but I am of the opinion that Toni Servillo does a much better job than the great Marcello Mastroianni in channeling the vulnerable desperation of a man whose vitality and virility is slowly fading away ... and there is nothing he can do about it. It's a hypnotic film that is also a feast for the eyes.

*A former hitman is hired for a job that spirals out of control.* 

**Kill List** can be a frustrating watch and I know many who have sat through the end were even more frustrated with the lack of an apparent resolution. Not that the film needs one, but it succeeds exactly in doing that — obscuring all the obvious things and leave you with many questions, which you may select to not ask for fear of raising some demon of the underground. Because, it is an incredibly creepy film with darkest-of-dark undertones.

*A father searches for his missing teenage daughter through her social media activity.* 

It could have easily died a horrible, quick death, with a gimmicky premise that everything on screen is via a camera of a device in the room, or a screencast of other devices in the room. But, somehow, it manages to make the whole narrative seamless. It is not trying to proseltyse about the ills of social media either (thankfully), which makes it an actual straight up thriller. With thr exception of being set in domestic environments.

*A teenage girl's life turns upside down after she witnesses a bus accident.* 

For a while the best reviewed film of 2011 was this yet-unreleased feature. The critics were raving about it in every publication, on- and offline. Needless to say there was quite a bit of an expectations on the film. And, thankfully, it lived up to (almost) all of it. It is a brilliant study of a teenager's desperate need for attention and how careless actions lead to lives being impacted. Be patient (the extended cut is over 3 hours long) and you will be rewarded.

*Washington Post gets hold of a story that involves corruption in the higher echelons of the US government.* 

It is likely that we will not see many old-school, high quality dramas like this anymore. When these films were all the rage come awards season, they are now a refreshing take on the same-old-same-old that dominate the cinemas. It is classy without being overly arrogant, very well made to the point of being nearly perfect, and just oozes quality from all its pores. Cherish it while it lasts.

*A hiker gets his arm stuck between two boulders in Utah.* 

Its based-on-a-true-story credentials and the hype surrounding *that* scene must have made it a difficult thing to deliver, considering the audience is constantly waiting for it. Added to that, in the majority of the film the main protagonist is immobile in a single location. But Danny Boyle somehow works his magic in making the rest of the film very engaging and relatable. It's not an easy watch, but it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. (And, no, its placement on this list is pure coincidence).

*A government agent is on his last time travel mission to hunt down the one person that eluded him.* 

This is a brainy (albeit a little convoluted) time travel film that pays as much effort in the logic behind it. Though, if you poke hard enough it will crumble and fall, it still tries better than most. Sarah Snook is a revelation here and Ethan Hawke does a pretty good job of the down-and-out agent, whose desperation grow by the minute. It is a very smart film that will urge you to re-watch it right away.

*An aboriginal farmhand shoots a white man in self-defense and goes on a run.* 

Although stylistically it's a Western, its specific undertones and context should probably be called an Austral, as we are as far removed from Far West as possible. The racial discrimination would probably feel akin to those felt by the Native Americans, but it is also a story that is rooted heavily in the Outback. It is an infuriating watch at times, but it is fascinating in its pacing and acting.

Michael Haneke's latest film came out with little fanfare (even a Haneke-obsessed like myself had forgotten it was coming out). Though it is decidedly a step back from some of his more recent work, it is still a very accomplished film from one of the greatest European auteurs of all time. The cast are uniformly brilliant and the ending did make me smile. Was it a happy one? Well ...

So much was made about the lengths to which Leonardo DiCaprio went with his role to make it as authentic as possible (I think at some point it was suggested that it was a real bear). Regardless of how true the trivia surrounding the film is, even if all are untrue, it is still a brilliant cinematic experience. DiCaprio gives it all he's got and Alejandro G. Iñárritu does a brilliant job of knitting it all together.

*A businesswoman is tracking down the man who raped her.* 

Isabelle Huppert in a Paul Verhoeven film? This was already on its way to be a winner. Though it is fair to argue that tonally it is a little uneven, but Huppert gives an iconic performance (in a career full of them) and the film takes dark and funny turns within minutes of each other. It is simply a joy to watch it. Not sure how I felt at the end, but I was sure that I didn't care about the story as much as I would have liked.
