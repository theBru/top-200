# Top 200 films of the decade, 2010 — 2019

{:#climax .film-name}
## *200.*{:.position} Climax

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Garpar Noé</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Garpar Noé</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">France, Belgium</span></p>

*A dance troupe organise a final party before their tour at the remote building where they've been rehearsing.*

It may be slightly more palatable for general consumption relative to his other films, but Gaspar Noé's latest experiment left me completely breathless by the end. The usual fluid camera and long, uncut scenes are still plenty, but how he paces this is truly astonishing. There is a 42-minute-uncut final scene (climax, if you will) which is as good as an example of nightmare on film I can think of. Unique in the truest sense.

{:#us .film-name}
## *199.*{:.position} US

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jordan Peele</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jordan Peele</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2019</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Us](/assets/img/us.jpg)

*A family run into their mute, murderous doppelgangers on a seaside trip.*

Jordan Peele's follow-up to the vastly successful (and vastly overrated) **Get out** is scarier than its predecessor and is not hampered by overt symbolism (though there is still a little bit of that here). It is a taut horror that delivers its scares in abundance and races to its finale in breakneck speed, with brilliant turns from Lupita Nyong'o and Shahadi Wright Joseph as the mother and daughter.

{:#the-house-that-jack-built .film-name}
## *198.*{:.position} The House That Jack Built

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Lars Von Trier</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Lars Von Trier</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, France, Sweden, Germany, Belgium</span></p>

![Still image from The House That Jack Built](/assets/img/the-house-that-jack-built.jpg)

*A failed architect recounts his violent murders to an angel.*

Don't call it a comeback, but Lars Von Trier needed something pretty special to make everyone forget about his bad joke from a few years ago. There are references to his previous work (some on-the-nose, some subtle), but if this is going to be his swansong as reported during its release, it is a fitting farewell from one of the best directors of our time — uncompromising, surprising, and still, sadly, uncomfortable in its treatment of women.

{:#booksmart .film-name}
## *197.*{:.position} Booksmart

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Olivia Wilde</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Susanna Fogel, Katie Silberman</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2019</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Booksmart](/assets/img/booksmart.jpg)

*Two high school best friends attempt to cram all the partying they missed out on the eve of their graduation.* 

Taking its cue from the best of high school comedies of yore, this is a smart, honest, and consistently laugh-out-loud funny. There is not a moment wasted as their world is superbly realised — an amazing feat by a first-time director. A film like this will rise or fall on its actors pulling off the best-friends chemistry and Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein deliver that in abundance.

{:#timbuktu .film-name}
## *196.*{:.position} Timbuktu

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Abderrahmane Sissako</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Abderrahmane Sissako, Kessen Tall</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Mauritania, France</span></p>

![Still image from Timbuktu](/assets/img/timbuktu.jpg)

*A herder and his family's life gets upended when Jihadists close in on their village.* 

Timbuktu, the land, conjures up conflicting images: it used to the land of unthinkable riches, it became an aspirational nirvana for the generation of '68, and now it's in the hands of a murderous cult. The film, which is one of the most stunningly beuatiful you will ever see, tries to maintain this balance, whilst showing all of these images are perhaps nothing but an outsider's perspective.

{:#starred-up .film-name}
## *195.*{:.position} Starred up

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">David Mackenzie</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jonathan Asser</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK</span></p>

![Still image from Starred up](/assets/img/starred-up.jpg)

*A young hardened convict is put in the same prison as his father.* 

Explosive from the start, this is a gritty prison drama that has more heart than it lets on. The performances are great throughout and without resorting to too many prison cliches, it manages to keep its modest premise alive all the way through. One of the shining lights of British cinema of this decade — sadly it wasn't a very popular one.

{:#julias-eyes .film-name}
## *194.*{:.position} Julia's Eyes

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Los ojos de Julia</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Guillem Morales</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Guillem Morales, Oriol Paulo</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Spain</span></p>

![Still image from Julia's Eyes](/assets/img/julias-eyes.jpg)

*A woman who is losing her sight is investigating her twin sister's death.* 

Carrying on from a rich surrealist cultural history, Spain have always produced top tier horror films and the decade started on a high with this creepy and disturbing film that bothers the ocula. Belén Rueda, who stars in another horror film higher up on this list, does a great job of balancing vulnerability and determination. Did I mention it was really scary?

{:#pina .film-name}
## *193.*{:.position} Pina

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Wim Wenders</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Wim Wenders</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Germany, France, UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Pina](/assets/img/pina.jpg)

*Pina Bausch's dancers perform some of her most famous pieces.* 

An ode to a woman who made poetic movement like no other, **Pina** is itself a celebration of moving pictures through another medium. If, at some point in the future, you end up catching this on a 3D showing on a big screen, make sure you don't miss. This is exactly the 3D technology was made for. Sit back, watch, and be in awe.

{:#ash-is-purest-white .film-name}
## *192.*{:.position} Ash Is Purest White

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Jiang hu er nü</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Zhangke Jia</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Zhangke Jia</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">China, France, Japan</span></p>

![Still image from Ash Is Purest White](/assets/img/ash-is-purest-white.jpg)

*A woman sacrifices her freedom for her mobster boyfriend only to be betrayed by him.* 

An allegory of the changing social and economic structures of China, Zhangke Jia's most recent film is a darkly funny and incredibly moving story of a woman who is trying to find som semblance of consistency in her life. It boasts a stunning performance by Tao Zhao, Zhangke Jia's wife.

{:#don-jon .film-name}
## *191.*{:.position} Don Jon

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Don Jon](/assets/img/don-jon.jpg)

*A porn addict tries to cure his addiction to be with the girl he is falling in love with.* 

Yet another debutant director who smashes it out of the park in a reversal of all romantic comedy cliches. It could have easily gone into the 'bro' zone, but Gordon-Levitt manages to steer the ship to calmer waters every time that opportunity rears its ugly head. It is funny, surprising affecting, and original.

{:#fruitvale-station .film-name}
## *190.*{:.position} Fruitvale Station

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Ryan Coogler</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Ryan Coogler</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from Fruitvale Station](/assets/img/fruitvale-station.jpg)

*A day in the life of a young man who ends up being on the wrong train.* 

There is something very immediate about **Fruitvale Station** and it goes beyond the contemporary racio-political outlook. It posits its characters and its story with minimal embellishments and that makes the searing finale all the more disturbing. Fittingly enough, we are led on a trainwreck that feels can be prevented, but more often than not isn't.

---

{:#a-hijacking .film-name}
## *189.*{:.position} A Hijacking

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Kapringen</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tobias Lindholm</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tobias Lindholm</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark</span></p>

![Still image from A Hijacking](/assets/img/a-hijacking.jpg)

*A sailor on a cargo ship is taken hostage along with his crew by the pirates.* 

It is easy to forget that the Somali pirate crisis was a pretty big thing back in the day. Although we have a Tom- Hanks-starring (and pretty decent) **Captain Phillips**, it has nothing compared to the sheer terror and claustrophobic panic of this little-seen Danish film. 

---

{:#theeb .film-name}
## *188.*{:.position} Theeb

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Naji Abu Nowar</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Naji Abu Nowar, Bassel Ghandour</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UAE, Qatar, Jordan, UK</span></p>

![Still image from Theeb](/assets/img/theeb.jpg)

*A young boy acts as a guide to a British officer in Arabia during World War I.* 

A coming-of-age film with a setting not at all familiar to many people who have seen it, this is a beautiful slice of minimalist filmmaking. Visually and emotionally stunning, it is a film full of silences and echoes that say so much more than a memorable piece of dialogue. 

---

{:#mollys-game .film-name}
## *187.*{:.position} Molly's Game

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2017</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">China, Canada, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Molly's Game](/assets/img/mollys-game.jpg)

*A woman sets up an underground gambling club for the ultra rich.* 

As an Aaron Sorkin fanboy, the thought of him directing a film was giving me all the good vibes in all the right places. Whilst the result is not the life-changing event I was perhaps hoping for, it was still a feast for the ears. Not taking anything away from Jessica Chastain, though, as she gave it all to nd suceeded brilliantly in a role that may have otherwise been there merely to read out the script. 

---

{:#john-wick .film-name}
## *186.*{:.position} John Wick

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Chad Stahelski</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Derek Kolstad</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2014</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from John Wick](/assets/img/john-wick.jpg)

*A retired assassin hunts down the people who killed his dog.* 

Ignoring all of its meme-inducing cult status and the brilliantly choreographed fight sequences, the thing that makes **John Wick** stands head-and-shoulders above everything else of the same ilk is its world-building abilities. More so than anything else I can think of, it is effortless in its depiction of the idiosyncracies of its world.

{:#stories-we-tell .film-name}
## *185.*{:.position} Stories We Tell

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sarah Polley</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sarah Polley, Michael Polley</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Canada</span></p>

![Still image from Stories We Tell](/assets/img/stories-we-tell.jpg)

*Director and actress Sarah Polley trawls through family videos to uncover stories from her family history.* 

An exercise in film-making to understand one's own existence is as old as cinema itself and while some examples excel (hello, Agnès Varda), most fail. Sarah Polley's own experiment is an eye-opening documentary that makes its very personal subjecty matter universally appealing and that's a rare talent to have.

{:#locke .film-name}
## *184.*{:.position} Locke

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Knight</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Knight</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Locke](/assets/img/locke.jpg)

*A construction sight foreman drives back to London overnight for a personal emergency on the eve of their grand opening.* 

If a film about a man driving at night and talking on the phone doesn't sound exciting or a suitable material for a thriller, then I've ogt some eye-opening news for you. Infinitely more exciting and nerve-racking than any city being annihilated by a super-hero, Tom Hardy gives a masterclass in minimalism in a film that is in itself a masterclass in minimalism.

{:#train-to-busan .film-name}
## *183.*{:.position} Train to Busan

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Busanhaeng</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sang-ho Yeon</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Sang-ho Yeon, Joo-Suk Park</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2016</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">South Korea</span></p>

![Still image from Train to Busan](/assets/img/train-to-busan.jpg)

*A man and his daughter are stuck on a train when a zombie epidemic breaks out.* 

It could be reduced merely as a 'zombies on a train' film and it would actually be right. The contextual elements (couple going through divorce, overworked father and a strained parental relationship) are all moot points, thankfully. This is a balls-to-the-wall zombie epic that goes as fast as the bullet train we are stuck on for the most part.

{:#in-a-better-world .film-name}
## *182.*{:.position} In a Better World

<p class="meta-tags"><em>Hævnen</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Susanne Bier</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Anders Thomas Jensen</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, Sweden</span></p>

![Still image from In a Better World](/assets/img/in-a-better-world.jpg)

*Two young boys and their respective parents are struggling to cope with the issues at home.* 

What is striking about **In a Better World** is its juxtaposiion of a war zone that we see on television screens and the war zone that occurs just outside those screens. How these two seemingly differing worlds intertwine is what Susanne Bier's multi-award-winning film tries to show. There are no answers, but facts of life and people struggling to face those facts.

{:#the-body .film-name}
## *181.*{:.position} The Body

<p class="meta-tags"><em>El cuerpo</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Oriol Paulo</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Oriol Paulo, Lara Sendim</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Spain</span></p>

![Still image from The Body](/assets/img/the-body.jpg)

*A detective is investigating the murder and the missing body of a wealthy woman.* 

Fresh off **Julia's Eyes**, its writer Oriol Paulo brings back Belén Rueda for another chiller that he directs — this time of the pulpier variety. Although it may have benefited immensely from a mini-series treatment for its subject matter, it is a very well made old-school thriller with a bit of horror mixed in that will leave you guessing until the very end. Incredibly smart and surprising.

---

{:#upgrade .film-name}
## *180.*{:.position} Upgrade

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Leigh Whannell</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Leigh Whannell</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2018</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Australia</span></p>

![Still image from Upgrade](/assets/img/upgrade.jpg)

*A man volunteers for a computer implant after suffering a life-altering accident.* 

A low-budget sci-fi actioner, which tackles a contemporary subject in a way many films would have struggled to make any sense of — bionic human in an age of technophobia. But the premise supplants the plot perfectly and becomes a catalyst for some of the most ingenious action sequences since perhaps **The Matrix**. Between us, it is better than that film too. 

---

{:#lincoln .film-name}
## *179.*{:.position} Lincoln

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Spielberg</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Tony Kushner</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2012</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA, India</span></p>

![Still image from Lincoln](/assets/img/lincoln.jpg)

*US President Abraham Lincoln tries to pass the emancipation legislation as the American Civil War is drawing to a close.* 

It's inevitably dominated by the greatest actor of his generation and without Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, this could have been a quality historical epic. It is an eerie performance of a man that none of us have seen in rea life, but I would guess nobody would question the authenticity of the performance. The rest of the film, of course, is also of the highest quality (this being a Spielberg film), but it indubitably belongs to Day-Lewis.

{:#moneyball .film-name}
## *178.*{:.position} Moneyball

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Bennett Miller</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">USA</span></p>

![Still image from moneyball](/assets/img/moneyball.jpg)

*The general manager of the baseball team Oakland Athletics uses data analytics to create a championship winning team on a budget.* 

For sports-to-watch nerds like myself, the story of Billy Beane's use of analytics is a legendary tale and in the hands of Bennett Miller and co-screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (fanboy alert), it becomes a classy drama that not only manages to be compelling watch, but also an emotionally satisfying one. Especially if you tend to root for the underdog.

{:#only-god-forgives .film-name}
## *177.*{:.position} Only God Forgives

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Nicolas Winding Refn</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Niolas Winding Refn</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2013</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">Denmark, France, USA, Sweden, Belgium</span></p>

![Still image from Only God Forgives](/assets/img/only-god-forgives.jpg)

*After his brother's death, a drug smuggler hunts down his killers as per his mother's insistence.* 

Released at the height of Ryan Gosling's meteoric rise to the hearts and minds of every film fan out there, **Only God Forgives** is a visually stunning film (albeit a little bit stunted on the pacing front) that refuses to hold back in its violence, both shown and obscured. It is a nightmarish film that slowly creeps under your skin and makes you forget how this all started by the time it ends.

{:#kick-ass .film-name}
## *176.*{:.position} Kick Ass

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Matthew Vaughn</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2010</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Kick Ass](/assets/img/kick-ass.jpg)

*A teenager decides to become a superhero despite having no discernible qualifications.* 

A giant fuck-you to any superhero story out there, there is something beautifully cathartic about Dave Lizewski succeeding in an industry that pretty much requires a tonne of money, smarts, or a radioactive bite or two. A punk anthem to your overblown pop rock anthems, if you like. A refreshing, funny-as-hell superhero film that probably will never be bettered.

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Taylor Sheridan</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Taylor Sheridan</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2017</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK, Canada, USA</span></p>

![Still image from Wind River](/assets/img/wind-river.jpg)

*A hunter and an FBI agent track down the people who killed a young woman.* 

Shot in the harsh Wyoming winter, this is the story of a frozen limbo in which hope is as frozen and snowed under as the landscape that surrounds everybody. Although there is a slight undertone of white-man-saving-the-natives feeling there, it doesn't take anything away from the beautiful scenery and the sense of dreadful acceptance of the worst. There is a glimmer of hope in the end, but it's obvious that this is all a part of the cycle that will repeat itself.

{:#rebellion .film-name}
## *174.*{:.position} Rebellion

<p class="meta-tags"><em>L'ordre et la morale</em> &#183; Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Mathieu Kassovitz</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Mathieu Kassovitz, Pierre Geller, Benoît Jaubert</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">France, New Caledonia</span></p>

![Still image from Rebellion](/assets/img/rebellion.jpg)

*After a police station in New Caledonia is overrun by rebels, France sends 300 soldiers to confront them.* 

Based on real events, what is striking about **Rebellion** is that it paints the political context behind the conflict better than most war films. Sure, there are impressive action sequences and compelling characters, but it's the bloodless conflict happening in the background (and thousands of miles away across two oceans) is the real driver behind all of the action on screen. And men and women are caught right in the middle of it.

![Still image from Moonlight](/assets/img/moonlight.jpg)

*An African-American man's struggle to come to terms with his identity and sexuality.* 

Without diminishing any of its qualities, **Moonlight** certainly benefitted the cultural zeitgeist when it was released. The fact that it took many this long to address the issue head-on is telling in itself, but even in isolation from its cultural context, Moonlight is a remarkable coming-of-age story with impeccable acting by a relatively unknown cast.

{:#tyrannosaur .film-name}
## *172.*{:.position} Tyrannosaur

<p class="meta-tags">Dir: <span class="font-weight-normal">Paddy Considine</span> &#183; Wri: <span class="font-weight-normal">Paddy Considine</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">2011</span> &#183; <span class="font-weight-normal">UK</span></p>

![Still image from Tyrannosaur](/assets/img/tyrannosaur.jpg)

*A rage-filled man finds redemption in the friendship of a Christian charity worker.* 

Peter Mullan, ever-present in many a British film as the tough guy, finds himself in the spotlight in Paddy Considine's feature directorial debut as the tough guy who softens up by an act of kindness he's been refused all his life. It is a difficult watch for many reasons, but the towering central performances by Mullan and the always brilliant Olivia Colman lift this up a level or ten. It is a mesmerising watch.
